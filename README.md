# The Deadlock Consortium's website for SecWebDev
Deeper [Documentation](https://github.com/TheDeadLockConsortium/Documentation) for further work.

## Reflection
While the Front end is passable there could be more time spent perfecting it. The backend should work to standard. If further front-end work needs to be done, it appears that the backend needs to move to [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/)
## How to run locally
clone the git repo, go to "code/strong-shell" and then run "run-front.sh" or "run-front.ps1" dependent on your terminal of choice. In a seperate terminal, run "run-back.sh" or "run-back.ps1"
